- **Build Time (s)**: Time required to build the index (lower is better)
- **Average Latency (ms)**: Average time per query (lower is better)

## Test Configuration

- **Document Corpus**: Research papers from `data/pdf_files`
- **Embedding Model**: `Annoy`
- **Chunk Size**: 500 tokens with 50 token overlap
- **Number of Test Queries**: 20 queries sampled from the corpus
- **Top-K Retrieval**: 10 documents per query

   - Consider the algorithm with the best QPS/latency balance
   - Prioritize query speed over build time

2. **High-Accuracy Requirements**:
   - Choose the algorithm with the highest recall
   - Acceptable to trade some speed for better accuracy

3. **Resource-Constrained Environments**:
   - Select the most memory-efficient algorithm
   - Balance memory usage with acceptable performance

4. **Frequent Index Updates**:
   - Opt for the algorithm with fastest build time
   - Important for dynamic document collections

## Conclusion

Each ANN algorithm has its own strengths and trade-offs. The choice depends on your specific requirements:

- If **query speed** is paramount ‚Üí Choose the fastest QPS algorithm
- If **accuracy** is critical ‚Üí Choose the highest recall algorithm
- If **memory** is limited ‚Üí Choose the most memory-efficient algorithm
- If **build time** matters ‚Üí Choose the fastest build algorithm

For this RAG-based Q&A system, we recommend evaluating the algorithms based on your production workload characteristics and resource constraints.
